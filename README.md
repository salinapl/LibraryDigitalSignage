## Backing up and Installing new Versions

### Kirby
Kirby is a Flat-file CMS and does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install and backup. Just copy the folder you installed Kirby and LibSignTool to into your backup location to back it up.

To upgrade Kirby, simply download the newest version of the plainkit, Delete the "kirby" and "media" folders from your install folder, and copy the new versions from the plainkit into the folder. Always refer to the offical Kirby documentation for upgrade instructions as these are subject to change between releases.

LibSignTool is built on Kirby 3. Staying within the same generation of releases should be fine, but wait for offical word before upgrading to possible future KirbyCMS generations such as Kirby 4

#### Kirby 4
Kirby 4 is now fully supported, Kirby 3 is not supported in versions v0.3.0 and newer

### LibSignTool

Follow instructions provided in the release notes. We will generally advise to back up the site, content, and any other folders you have modified before upgrading. Typically extracting everything from the upgrade archive but the content folder is sufficent to avoid issues with data loss, but a backup is always recommended before attempting an upgrade.
