## Backing up and Installing new Versions

### Kirby
Kirby is a Flat-file CMS and does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install and backup. Just copy the folder you installed Kirby and LibSignTool to into your backup location to back it up.

To upgrade Kirby, simply download the newest version of the plainkit, Delete the "kirby" and "media" folders from your install folder, and copy the new versions from the plainkit into the folder. Always refer to the offical Kirby documentation for upgrade instructions as these are subject to change between releases.

LibSignTool is built on Kirby 3. Staying within the same generation of releases should be fine, but wait for offical word before upgrading to possible future KirbyCMS generations such as Kirby 4

#### Kirby 4
Kirby 4 has been announced with a licensing change that requires kirby 3 owners to buy a new license. looking at the feature set in Kirby 4, we are planning to upgrade as I see several features we can utilize that would have required adding required extensions before (one example is the color palletes tool, I was already planning a theming feature for web slides, this tool would let us do theming without a needed extension. I will specify if a release is for Kirby 3 or 4, however after we upgrade to Kirby 4, we are unlikely to continue to support Kirby 3 in future releases.

### LibSignTool

Follow instructions provided in the release notes. We will generally advise to back up the site, content, and any other folders you have modified before upgrading. Typically extracting everything from the upgrade archive but the content folder is sufficent to avoid issues with data loss, but a backup is always recommended before attempting an upgrade.

## A Note about Licensing

While LibSignTool is provided free under the GPLv3 License, Kirby is not.

You can try Kirby on your local machine or on a test
server as long as you need to make sure it is the right
tool for your next project.

However Production use requires a License Key.
