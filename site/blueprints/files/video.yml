# Each file blueprint must have a title, the title may be different from the file name
title: Video
accept: video/mp4, video/webm, video/m4v
# Like page blueprints, file blueprints can define a layout with tabs, columns, sections and fields
# File blueprints define what sort of information should get stored in a file's meta data file
# In addition to the fields defined in this example blueprint, you can also set what type of file is acceptable
# when this blueprint is used, which allows you to control what users can upload.
